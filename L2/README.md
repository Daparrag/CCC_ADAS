## Challenge 2

From now on you will get information of the current speed limit and the next speed limit. You will get a speeding ticket if you drive 3 km/h faster as the current speed limit. Avoid speeding tickets to finish this level.


- Drive a distance of 1500 meters
- Avoid speeding tickets
- Finish the test drive in under 100 seconds

### Speed Limits

**`current-limit :`** the current speed limit in km/h (2 decimals).

**`distance-to-next :`** the distance to the next speed limit in meters (2 decimals).

**`next-limit :`** the distance to the next speed limit in meters (2 decimals).

If distance-to-next and next-limit are 0 then there is no next speed limit.

On the next slides there is additional information how the speed of the car changes when you accelerate and decelerate.
